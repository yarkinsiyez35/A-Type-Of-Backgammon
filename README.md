# A-Type-Of-Backgammon
This is a backgammon game called as "Kız Tavlası" in Turkish. 
There are 2 players in this sequential game. Each player puts 1 piece to each triangle. Each player throws 2 dies. At the first part of the game players add the pieces to their triangles. The aim in the first part is to put 2 pieces in the first 3 triangles and put 3 pieces in the last 3 triangles. After the first part is finished, players then throws dies to remove pieces. The first player to remove every piece wins the game. 
The game is normally played with 6 triangles for each player but this project allows players to have more or less triangles.
